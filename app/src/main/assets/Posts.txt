ian.oliver@gmail.com [Baby-to-be looking for car seat for a one-off taxi ride] {Hi everyone! Our new baby should be able to breathe by her own means the fresh air of Glasgow by the end of April. We will travel back from hospital by cab and were told a car seat was absolutely mandatory. As we don't have a car and have no intention of getting one, we obviously don't plan to buy a car seat! I was then wondering if, by chance, anyone would have a spare newborn suitable car seat to lend us...? Many thanks in advance for your interest!} (Borrow) \17-02-2016/
